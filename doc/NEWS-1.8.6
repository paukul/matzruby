This document is a list of user visible feature changes made between
releases except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept so brief that no reason behind or

== Changes since the 1.8.5 release

=== New platforms/build tools support

* IA64 HP-UX

* Visual C++ 8 SP1

* autoconf 2.6x

=== Global constants

* RUBY_PATCHLEVEL

  New constant since 1.8.5-p1.

=== Library updates (outstanding ones only)

* builtin classes

  * New method: Kernel#instance_variable_defined?

  * New method: Module#class_variable_defined?

  * New feature: Dir::glob() can now take an array of glob patterns.

* date

  * Updated based on date2 4.0.3.

* digest

  * New internal APIs for C and Ruby.

  * Support for autoloading.

      require 'digest'

      # autoloads digest/md5
      md = Digest::MD5.digest("string")

  * New digest class methods: file

  * New digest instance methods: clone, reset, new, inspect,
    digest_length (alias size or length), block_length()

  * New library: digest/bubblebabble

  * New function: Digest(name)

* fileutils

  * New option for FileUtils.cp_r(): :remove_destination

* nkf

  * Updated based on nkf as of 2007-01-28.

* thread

  * Replaced with much faster mutex implementation in C.  The former
    implementation, which is slow but considered to be stable, is
    available with a configure option `--disable-fastthread'.

* tk

  * Updated Tile extension support based on Tile 0.7.8.

  * Support --without-X11 configure option for non-X11 versions of
    Tcl/Tk (e.g. Tcl/Tk Aqua).

  * New sample script: irbtkw.rbw -- IRB on Ruby/Tk. It has no trouble
    about STDIN blocking on Windows.

* webrick

  * New method: WEBrick::Cookie.parse_set_cookies()

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* builtin classes

  * String#intern now raises SecurityError when $SAFE level is greater
    than zero.

* date

  * Time#to_date and Time#to_datetime are added as private methods.
    They cause name conflict error in ActiveSupport 1.4.1 and prior,
    which comes with Rails 1.2.2 and prior.  Updating ActiveSupport
    and/or Rails to the latest versions fixes the problem.

* digest

  * The constructor does no longer take an initial string to feed.
    The following examples show how to migrate:

      # Before
      md = Digest::MD5.new("string")
      # After (works with any version)
      md = Digest::MD5.new.update("string")
        
      # Before
      hd = Digest::MD5.new("string").hexdigest
      # After (works with any version)
      hd = Digest::MD5.hexdigest("string")

  * Digest::Base#==

    * self == string

      Automatic detection between binary digest values and hexadecimal
      digest values has been dropped.  It is always assumed that a
      hexadecimal digest value is given for comparison.

    * self == md

      Digest objects are compared by the resulting digest values, not
      by the exact vector states.

* fileutils

  * A minor implementation change breaks Rake <=0.7.1.
    Updating Rake to 0.7.2 or higher fixes the problem.

* tk

  * Tk::X_Scrollable (Y_Scrollable) is renamed to Tk::XScrollable
    (YScrollable). Tk::X_Scrollable (Y_Scrollable) is still available,
    but it is an alias name.
